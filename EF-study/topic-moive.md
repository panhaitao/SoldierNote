'The Artist' is just like one of those old films. This romance was made in gorgeous black and white and takes place in the 1920s. And, just like the old films, there's no talking. There are only a few subtitles. But it's certainly not a remake of one of the old films from the 1920s. Remember how some of those old movies had really bad acting? Well, the acting in 'The Artist' is brilliant, and actor Berenice Bejo is incredible. This movie also has an original plot. 'The Artist' shows us what happens when a famous person has really bad luck. I won't tell you how it ends – see 'The Artist' for yourself.
