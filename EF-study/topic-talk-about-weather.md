Why can't weather forecasters get it right?

Meteorologists use computer programs called weather models to make forecasts. Since we can't collect data from the future, models have to use estimates and assumptions to predict future weather. The atmosphere is changing all the time, so those estimates are less reliable the further you get into the future

Is weather really unpredictable?

Meteorologists have the job of predicting changes in weather, but there are a lot of factors that affect weather: temperature, air pressure, cloud patterns, precipitation, and wind factors including its speed, direction, and moisture level.
