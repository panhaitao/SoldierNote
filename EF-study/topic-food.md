没有两份菜单是一样的，但绝大多数被分为几个成分，诸如starters, main courses 和desserts。识别这些成分和知道在它们中要寻找什么会使得餐单更容易认读。
 
Starters, 或appetizers通常出现在菜单的开头。这部分也许包括诸如soups and salads的小部分。
 

A: Would you like a starter?
B: The cheese appetizer sounds really good. 	您要开胃菜吗？
奶酪开胃菜听起来真的不错。

下一环节通常是main courses, 或 entrees。 Entree是一个法语词。听听该词的发音。

The fish comes with rice and beans. 	鱼搭配米饭和豆


如果您想要一份额外的食物，如薯条或蔬菜，来和您的主食一起吃或分享，那么您可以点一份 side dish.
 

Let's get some extra side dishes for everybody at the table.	我们给桌上的每个人再来点配菜吧。

Desserts通常放在菜单的末尾，许多Desserts是根据它们的原产国而得名的。听听以下Desserts的发音。
 
tiramisu	        提拉米苏                          
chocolate mousse	巧克力慕斯
lemon sorbet     	柠檬果汁冰球


可数名词和不可数名词的量词

记住，大多数名词都是可数的，比如 apple 和 steak。这些可数名词都有复数形式，词尾通常是 s。
